# Architecture Boundaries, Workarounds, Tech Debt

Purpose: respect the project's layering; make every shortcut visible.

## Boundaries

- Follow the project's existing architecture. Forbidden: business logic in UI or
  controllers when a service layer exists; direct storage access in handlers when a
  repository layer exists; bypassing existing services and abstractions without cause;
  circular module dependencies; dumping unrelated logic into catch-all files.
- If the architecture genuinely blocks the task, do not hack around it — propose a
  proper structural change and reflect it in the architecture docs once approved.
- A doc-comment-only boundary is not enforced. Use a type only the check can construct,
  or a gate no caller can skip — and test that it accepts, not only that it rejects.

## Temporary solutions

- Workarounds are allowed only exceptionally, and every one must be recorded
  explicitly: why it exists, where it lives, its limits and risks, and when it must be
  replaced.
- Hidden workarounds are forbidden. Do not scatter uncontrolled `TODO`/`FIXME` marks;
  important debt gets a task or an entry in the project's tracking process.

## Tech debt

- Debt found during a task that cannot be fixed now is recorded explicitly (in the
  final report at minimum), never disguised as a normal solution.
- Debt touching security, data integrity, performance, or stability is priority debt —
  call it out loudly.
